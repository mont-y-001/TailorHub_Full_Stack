🧵 Tailor Hub – MERN Stack Web Application
A digital platform connecting customers with local tailors
📌 About the Project

Tailor Hub is a MERN-stack web application built as part of a KIET College Web Development Project.
It helps local tailors go online and makes it easier for customers to book stitching and alteration services.

The platform solves the biggest challenges local tailors face:
✔ Low online visibility
✔ Manual order management
✔ No digital customer communication

Tailor Hub brings all of this into a clean and modern online system.
